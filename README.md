# linear-tests

very WIP don't even bother looking at this yet.

This library is mainly meant for providing `Arbitrary` instances of data types in the `linear` library to be used in other packages (that I'm writing). Stuff will be added here incrementally, and eventually, if I have the time, will add property tests for methods in the `linear` package itself.
